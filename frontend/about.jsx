            I'm Andrew Seo, a CS student with an intense passion for programming.
            <br/>
            I discovered my passion my senior year at Vanderbilt. I hadn't programmed anything since high school, when I took AP Java, but I thought 
            I'd pick it up again for fun. Little did I know, that 
            decision would <strong>change the course of my life.</strong> I fell in love, fast. I started on MIT OpenCourseware, taking the intro 
            programming classes in Python. They felt like such an amazing change of pace from what I was learning at Vanderbilt. 
            So much of my biochemistry coursework was just about memorization: memorize how this reagent reacts with that reagent, 
            memorize how this molecule interacts with that molecule. 
            <br/>
            But programming was all about problem solving, logic, puzzles. It brought me back to 
            my junior high days as a math nerd, when I would spend my free time playing chess and going to math competitions.
            Soon, I started devouring all things programming. MIT OpenCourseware, Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, C++ Primer, AppAcademy Open. The deeper I got into coding, the more I felt 
            in my element, like this was what I was born to do. It all felt so natural, so fun. Before, I would spend most of my free time playing video games and 
            watching Youtube videos; now, it was all dedicated to coding. 
            <br/>
            At this point, I realized that I had reached <strong>the point of no return.</strong> I started dreading going to my classes. 
            Why was my professor teaching me about growing E. Coli cultures? I was daydreaming about coding in my classes, 
            the challenges on my laptop begging to be solved.
            <br/>
            Ever since we were all sent home for the pandemic, I have been programming and learning programming religiously. If studying coding was a full time job, I would 
            have earned a healthy amount of overtime. Without a doubt, it is a big risk to just drop all of my previous career plans in pursuit of this. But honestly, it hasn't 
            felt like a risk at all. For the first time, I know exactly what I want to do with the rest of my life. And I have no plans of slowing down.
